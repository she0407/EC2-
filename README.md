## Instance Types
**1. General Purpose Instances (T-Series):**
T2: Store extra CPU power when not in use, suitable for small to medium-sized websites and basic development.
T3: Faster overall, better handling of sudden CPU spikes.
**2. Compute Optimized Instances (C-Series):**
Best for compute-heavy tasks such as powerful web servers or complex scientific calculations.
**3. Memory Optimized Instances (R-Series):**
Suitable for large databases and applications requiring lots of memory.
**4. Storage Optimized Instances (I-Series):**
Perfect for storage-intensive apps that require fast SSD storage for large files and databases.
